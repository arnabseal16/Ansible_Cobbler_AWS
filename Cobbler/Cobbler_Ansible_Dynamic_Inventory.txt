. Place cobbler.py in /etc/ansible and give it execute permissions (chmod +x)

. Add cobbler.ini in /etc/ansible to locate the cobbler server template provided below:

    [cobbler]

    # Set Cobbler's hostname or IP address
    host = http://127.0.0.1/cobbler_api

    # API calls to Cobbler can be slow. For this reason, we cache the results of an API
    # call. Set this to the path you want cache files to be written to. Two files
    # will be written to this directory:
    #   - ansible-cobbler.cache
    #   - ansible-cobbler.index

    cache_path = /tmp

    # The number of seconds a cache file is considered valid. After this many
    # seconds, a new API call will be made, and the cache file will be updated.

    cache_max_age = 900

. To use dynamic inventory for ansible use:

  ansible-playbook <playbookname> -u <user> -i /etc/ansible/cobbler.py
